# Introduction to Python language

We introduce here the Python language. 
The material presented are in reference form [scipy-lecture-notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/index.html). 
To learn more about the language, consider going through the
excellent tutorials on scipy-lectures as well as dedicated books, such as http://www.diveintopython.net/.

Python is a **programming language**, as are C, Fortran, BASIC, PHP,
etc. Some specific features of Python are as follows:

* an *interpreted* (as opposed to *compiled*) language. Contrary to e.g.
C or Fortran, one does not compile Python code before executing it. In
addition, Python can be used **interactively**: many Python
interpreters are available, from which commands and scripts can be
executed.

* a free software released under an **open-source** license: Python can
be used and distributed free of charge, even for building commercial
software.

* **multi-platform**: Python is available for all major operating
systems, Windows, Linux/Unix, MacOS X, most likely your mobile phone
OS, etc.

* a very readable language with clear non-verbose syntax

* a language for which a large variety of high-quality packages are
available for various applications, from web frameworks to scientific
computing.

* a language very easy to interface with other languages, in particular C
and C++.

* Some other features of the language are illustrated just below. For
example, Python is an object-oriented language, with dynamic typing
(the same variable can contain objects of different types during the
course of a program).



See https://www.python.org/about/ for more information about
distinguishing features of Python.

In this course we will try to cover:
* basic_types
* control_flow
* functions
* basic_operation
* main_scripts
* input_output
* standard_libraries
* object-oriented programming
